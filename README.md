Scattered scripts from moments of inspiration 

These are intended to be as self-contained as possible, unless I'm working with a particular dataset in mind.  Online Retail and MovieLens will probably show up a bit. 

A lot of these are really short bursts of wanting to capture some concept; some are reproductions with modifications of code snippets produced by others - I put a link in those for referential integrity and a sense of academic *honesty*.
